# First_Task
 Task: Configration for composer.json file,in a way that can autoload your folders and classes.
 
 Because its common to define each php classes in separate files in order to use this classes we need to require them if we have a lot of seperate files we need to      require all of them there is another solution makes our code cleaner called autoloading.
 
 Autoloading is useful for load classes automatically ,so you dont need to require them.
